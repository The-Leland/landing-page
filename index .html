      <h2>About The X-Men</h2>
      <p>A few things to get to know The X-Men from Marvel Comics.
    
        Here's a brief synopsis of Marvel's X-Men: <br>
        <br>
    
        <strong>1. The Beginning (1963-1970s)</strong><br>
        The <em>X-Men</em> were created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, debuting in <em>X-Men #1</em> in 1963. 
        The team was composed of young mutants, including Cyclops (Scott Summers), Jean Grey, Beast (Henry McCoy),
        Angel (Warren Worthington III), and Iceman (Bobby Drake), led by Professor Charles Xavier. 
        The central idea was that mutants, individuals born with special powers, faced prejudice and fear from society. 
        This theme of civil rights and acceptance was present throughout the series. In the early years, 
        the X-Men fought against mutant threats like Magneto, their primary foe, who believed mutants should dominate humanity. <br>

        <br>
        <strong>2. The "Silver Age" and the Growth of the Team (1970s-1980s)</strong><br>
        In the 1970s, the team began to expand. Key additions included Wolverine (Logan), Storm (Ororo Munroe), Colossus (Piotr Rasputin), 
        Nightcrawler (Kurt Wagner), and Thunderbird (John Proudstar). The team shifted to an international focus, 
        and stories began to explore more complex themes of alienation, identity, and social justice. 
        The <em>Dark Phoenix Saga</em> (1976-1977), where Jean Grey becomes the Phoenix Force and ultimately sacrifices herself, 
        is one of the most defining story arcs of this era. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>3. The Mutant Massacre and "X-Men" Expansion (1980s-1990s)</strong><br>
        The <em>Mutant Massacre</em> (1986) storyline, which involved the X-Men facing off against the Marauders, 
        marked a darker era where the team faced greater threats. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the X-Men's popularity skyrocketed, 
        especially with the launch of <em>X-Men #1</em> (1991) by Chris Claremont and Jim Lee, which featured a new lineup. 
        This era is known for the <em>X-Men</em> branching into multiple teams, including the <em>X-Force</em>, a more aggressive offshoot, 
        and <em>X-Factor</em>, focusing on the original X-Men team. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>4. The Age of Apocalypse (1995)</strong><br>
        One of the most pivotal and alternate-timeline events in <em>X-Men</em> comics is the <em>Age of Apocalypse</em> (1995), 
        where the villain Apocalypse takes over the world. This storyline is crucial in shaping the X-Men's legacy, 
        involving a darker, more dystopian reality where the X-Men are forced to fight for survival in a world ruled by mutants. 
        The <em>Age of Apocalypse</em> also gave rise to alternate versions of beloved characters. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>5. The "M-Day" Era and Mutant Decimation (2000s)</strong><br>
        In the 2000s, the team underwent significant changes, especially after the <em>M-Day</em> storyline (2005), 
        where the mutant population was drastically reduced from millions to just around 200. 
        This era explored the fallout from this decimation, leading to the rise of new groups like <em>X-Force</em> and the <em>X-Men</em>'s 
        focus on a survivalist mentality. One notable addition during this time was the mutant island of Krakoa, 
        a sentient island where the X-Men set up their sanctuary. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>6. Krakoa and the Dawn of a New Era (2019-Present)</strong><br>
        The <em>Dawn of X</em> era, starting with <em>House of X</em> and <em>Powers of X</em> (2019), 
        brought a major shift in how mutants and the X-Men were portrayed. With the creation of the mutant island nation of Krakoa, 
        mutants are no longer a marginalized group but have their own society and culture. 
        The mutant resurrection protocols and the political intrigue within Krakoa have been central to the storylines. 
        This new direction, overseen by Jonathan Hickman, blends superhero action with a heavy focus on mutant politics, philosophy, 
        and the future of the species. It's an era of mutant unity and self-determination, 
        though it also presents new challenges for the X-Men and their allies. <br>
        <br>
        Throughout all these years, <em>X-Men</em> comics have been notable for their exploration of themes such as civil rights, 
        oppression, identity, diversity, and survival, often drawing parallels to real-world social issues. <br>
        <br>
        This is just a high-level overview, but the <em>X-Men</em> comics have explored many rich and diverse arcs, 
        with numerous writers, artists, and storylines that have shaped the team's evolution. <br>
        <br>
        Below are just some of the many X-Men and X-Women. ;)
